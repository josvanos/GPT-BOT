# GPT-BOT


The bot requires from you:
- Node version 16+.
- In order to get the bot working, change the `.env.example` file into `.env`.
- define the OPENAI_API_KEY from your OPEN AI account
- the remainder of the .env variables are related to probot. Please make yourself familiar with their docs in order to run this bot. (https://probot.github.io/docs/)

In local development it also requires SMEE client (Ngrok alternative)

Good luck!
